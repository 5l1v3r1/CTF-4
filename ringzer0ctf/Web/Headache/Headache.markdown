##### [Headache](http://ringzer0team.com/challenges/43)
##### Answer
As you see `Answer is closer than you think!`, first we try to see the http headers.  
So we use Inspect element of out browser and use the network tab to see details and headers of the http file.  
And the resualt is:
```
Form Data:
  flag:FLAG-365m4fU5p2DVEQbfrptDE5Ru
  id:43
  csrf:17371196f440d4d8a77db6e843ea1c3e
```
As you see the flag is `FLAG-365m4fU5p2DVEQbfrptDE5Ru`

Happy new flag ;). Think about why the challenge name is `Headache`?
