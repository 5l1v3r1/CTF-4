#####[Area 51](http://ringzer0team.com/challenges/48)

As you see the text is protected by `.htaccess` file.  
We know usually people don't check the `PUT` request method so simply we make a `PUT` request to the site and give the flag.  
```
.

.
<span class="red">AREA 51</span> The origin of the Area 51 name is unclear? Alien?<br /><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">FLAG-w4KRr557y626izv567758O52</div>						<br />
.
.
.
```
So as you see the flag is `FLAG-w4KRr557y626izv567758O52`.  

Keep calm and CTF ;)
