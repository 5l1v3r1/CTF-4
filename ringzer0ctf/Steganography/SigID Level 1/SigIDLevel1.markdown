#####Answer

After hearing some part of the song we understand that the sound has noise so we must use a frequency shower application.  
I have used [sonic visualiser](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/). Then after installing the application we open the `.ogg` file and then in `Layer` tab we'll select `Add Spectogram` The we can see a [Aztec code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code), Sth like qr codes, it's enough to scan it.

after grabbing the `Aztec code` and change thresholds we can scan it by a QR reader.
The result is `mathsRulesTheUniverse` and this the FLAG :D.

As you see there are some other things in the frequency plot. They are some Morse codes that are `HINT` for [SigID level2](http://ringzer0team.com/challenges/137). I'll decode them in its time.

As you can see Steganography is awesome, Keep calm and solve all of them :D
