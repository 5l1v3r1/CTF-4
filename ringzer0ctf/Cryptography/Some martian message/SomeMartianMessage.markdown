##### [Some martian message](http://ringzer0team.com/challenges/25)
##### Answer

Here is the message:
```
SYNTPrfneVfPbbyOhgAbgFrpher
```
it seems the message is a `cesarean cipher` so we use a [decryption tool](http://www.xarg.org/tools/caesar-cipher/) to decrypt this and the shifts count is `13` because the `FLAG` has became `SYNT` after decrypting the flag is `FLAGCesarIsCoolButNotSecure`

Enjoy easy flags :D
