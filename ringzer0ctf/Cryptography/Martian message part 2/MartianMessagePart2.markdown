#####Answer

There is a key and a cipher text there in the page. because the cipher text is set of printable characters the crypto algorithm must be sth like Cesar Cipher; The Crypto Alg. is `Vigenère cipher` so easily we can use an [online tool](http://www.krisl.net/cgi-bin/vignere.pl) to decrypt the cipher:  
The flag is `FLAGU2JNU1R1X96VOFNKHLB1GEWQ`.  

Be happy and don't use Cesar and Vigenère cipher ;)
