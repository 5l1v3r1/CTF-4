* LIGHTNING  
You work as a security consultant, and one day a company calls you to solve a curious problem: after one night the company building was hit by a lightning, the vault could no longer be opened with the code, which is 0994. Unfortunately, the vault control hardware is inside the vault itself. You start building a breadboard prototype of the vault circuit, and after a lot of modeling and experiments, you come to the conclusion that the lightning has caused a "stuck at 1" fault on pin 14 of IC6. Based on the circuit diagram you come up with a code that could open the faulty vault. The flag is the concatenation of what appears on the display, and what you have to type in the keyboard. N.B. Flag is not in the format flag{.*}

Last month I was trying to simplify an algorithm.. and I found how to mess up a source really really bad. And then this challenge is born. Maybe is really simple or maybe is so hard that all of you will give up. Good luck!

* JOHN THE PACKER  
John's greatest skill is to pack everything and everywhere with everyone. He doesn't want that someone reverse his super secret program. So he wrote a magic packing system. Can you show to John that his packing system is not a good anti-reversing solution? 
N.B. Unfortunately John The Packer has multiple solution, so if you have a solution that is not accepted by the scoreboard (but is accepted by the binary) please contact an OP on IRC  
* EXCEPTIONALLY-OBFUSCATED  
Yet another license manager trying to protect a propietary application. The main application calls it with a challenge '84563472956326492361085746284624', the license key, and expects a response that is internally called a 'flag'. I wonder if the've implemented it securely with real crypto or it's just some crap hidden behind a bit of security through obscurity. Only one way to find out...

* JOHN THE TRAVELLER  
Holidays are here! But John still hasn't decided where to spend them and time is running out: flights are overbooked and prices are rising every second. Fortunately, John just discovered a website where he can book last second flight to all the European capitals; however, there's no time to waste, so he just grabs his suitcase and thanks to his new smartphone he looks the city of his choice up while rushing to the airport. There he goes! Flight is booked so... hauskaa lomaa!

* JOHN PASTRY SHOP
Among his hobbies, John likes baking cakes to eat during the warm afternoons in Milan.
He is damn good at this such that, a couple of months ago, he decided to open a pastry shop on his own. The shop was an immediate success and John needed to bake just so many cakes that he decided to outsource the production of his famous NewYorkCheeseCake to another external and trusted pastry shop, the Shamano's (see shamanoPastryShop.pem). John provided Shamano's with the original basic recipe of his Cake (see Cake.java) and, after his customization, Shamano returns to John a cake container holding the NewYorkCheeseCake (see ShamanoCakeContainerEncoded.jar). Notice that Shamano has to follow John's directions carefully and that is why he always have to encode properly his cake containers so that John can verify all of them accordingly to a fixed decoding process (see extract of source code in Decode.java). John always tries his best for verifying the quality and genuineness of the incoming NewYorkCheeseCake but, you know, to busy people, like he is, it may sometimes happen to forget to check something... You can find the shop at
